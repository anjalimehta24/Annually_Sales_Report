# Annually_Sales_Report
1. Designed and Developed Annual Sales Report with the help of sample dataset from Kaggle and used Excel to visualize and manipulate it.
2. One of the key component of the report was the region wise sales count and with this also calculated the maximum selling category price.
3. In addition to the regional analysis, I also calculated selling growth on a Yearly, Monthly, and Weekly basis.
4. There is 67% increase in Yearly selling growth, 61% increase in Monthly selling growth ( sales have more than tripled, as the increase in sales is more than 100%) and will able to see that there is 44% decline in selling growth if we go for Weekly sales.
5. To make the data accessible and visually appealing, I have also created Charts.
6. For Example: Line Chart to show the Weekly sales trend, and for Yearly and Monthly I have created Bar Charts.
